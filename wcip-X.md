## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the WCIP.-->

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for WCIPs. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the WCIP solves. WCIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation is critical for WCIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the WCIP solves. WCIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Trade-offs and Risks

<!--All WCIPs must explain the various trade-offs and risks associated with the changes suggested.-->

## Implementation

<!--While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
